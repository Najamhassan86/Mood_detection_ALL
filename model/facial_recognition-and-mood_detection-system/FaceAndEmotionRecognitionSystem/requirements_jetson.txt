# Requirements for Jetson Nano ONNX Inference
# Lightweight dependencies optimized for ARM architecture

# Core dependencies
opencv-python
numpy
# onnxruntime==1.16.3

# Note: For Jetson Nano with GPU acceleration, you can install onnxruntime-gpu
# However, you'll need to build it from source for ARM architecture
# See: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/main/BUILD.md#arm64

# Optional: For GPU support on Jetson (advanced users)
# You'll need to build onnxruntime-gpu from source with CUDA support
# Instructions: https://elinux.org/Jetson_Zoo#ONNX_Runtime
